# NUCL 575 Final Project - Purdue University

### Files for Final Project:

You can download the files by using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marioutiel/NUCL_FP.git
```
It contains 3 python files:

1) **data.py**

To download and prepare data before inputting it to the model

2) **model_train.py**

Where the Neural Network is defined and initialize. Also, it is trained directly with the training set.

Has two parameters:
  - **conv**: (boolean) If we want to train a Convolutional Neural Network (conv=1) or a Fully Connected Neural Network (conv=0)
  - **n_epochs**: (integer) How many epochs we want to use to train the network (default=15)

3) **evaluate.py**

To evaluate the performance of the NN using the test set. Comparing also the train and eval sets

Has one parameter:
  - **conv**: (boolean) If we want to evaluate the CNN (conv=1) or the FCNN (conv=0)
